I am an Assistant Professor of Artificial Intelligence at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. I hold an engineering degree in Industrial Engineering from the Moroccan Design and Technology Engineering School and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Aix-Marseille University, France (2018). My research interests focus on sequential modeling and multimodal deep learning for understanding the dynamics of humanâ€“machine interactions. In particular, I am interested in integrating structured data such as natural language and visual information with less structured modalities like brain activity.

Beyond research, I have a strong passion for teaching and supervision. At the International Artificial Intelligence Center of Morocco (AI Movement), I currently teach modules on Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, emphasizing both theoretical foundations and practical applications. I also supervise Ph.D. students whose work aligns closely with my research interests, including large language models, multimodal AI, and brain decoding.
