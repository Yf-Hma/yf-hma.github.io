I am an Assistant Professor in Artificial Intelligence at Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. I hold an engineering degree in Industrial Engineering from the Moroccan Design and Technology Engineering School and a PhD in Computer Science from Aix-Marseille University in France (2018). My research interests include sequential modeling and multimodal deep learning to understand the dynamics of human-machine interactions. I am particularly interested in combining structured data like natural language and visual information with less structured modalities such as brain activity.

In addition to my research activities, I have a strong passion for teaching and supervision. At the International Artificiel Intelligence Center of Morocco (AI Movement), I currently teach modules in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, where I emphasize both theoretical foundations and practical applications. I also supervise PhD students working on topics closely aligned with my research interests, including Large Language Models, multimodal AI, and brain decoding.
